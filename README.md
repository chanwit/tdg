# Test-Driven Generation

This repository contains the concepts of Test-Driven Generation (TDG) and rule files for Cursor and Windsurf.

## What is TDG?
TDD is a human development practice, TDG is the same but for AI.
TDG allows us to Vibe Coding without Chaos.

I introduced TDG in 2024 as a practice that extends TDD with AI as an assiant.
Now with Agentic AIs being already availble as part of editors like Cursor, Windsurf etc, 
I have realized that TDG was not the process for human, but it's for AI with us as human-in-the-loop.

A TDG implementation is an encoding of best practices we used to do during development as AI rule files.
We now tell AI to follow these rules so that we hopefully can vibe high quality code.
